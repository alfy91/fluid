	<h3 class="title lowercase">transparency, explorability and explainability in data science and data visualisation</h3>
</div>
<div class="col-9-12">

	<p>My interest is in new programming language foundations for transparent and
	explorable digital media. A scientific paper should allow a reviewer to drill
	into a bar chart to see the underlying distribution, tweak model parameters,
	or remove an outlier from the dataset to see how the results would be
	affected, all within the context of the paper.

   <p>Modern interactive notebooks for data science, such as Jupyter, provide a
   certain level of transparency by capturing the steps of a workflow and
   showing intermediate results such as statistical data or charts. However the
   steps themselves remain black boxes: if I want to understand how a complex
   chart is obtained, there is no easy way to break that step into substeps
   or to investigate how various aspects of the chart depend on specific bits of
   data or code.

   <p>My research focuses on tools and techniques that expose, to readers as
   well as authors, this fine-grained structure. This will make it possible to
   create digital media which reveal how parts of visualisations relate to data
   and code. For example, removing a data point or changing visualisation logic
   will automatically update only the affected parts of a dependent
   visualisation and moreover make it visually apparent which parts changed.
   Both authors and readers will be able to conduct “experiments” &mdash; to
   formulate hypotheses about the fine-grained relationships between code and
   data which they can test by changing things and observing the consequences.
