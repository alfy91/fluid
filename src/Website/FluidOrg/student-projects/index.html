      <p>Fluid is an exciting opportunity to work on new programming language foundations designed to make
      data science more open, intelligible and accessible. If you are a University of Cambridge MPhil or Part
      III student in Computer Science looking for a project this October, and would like to discuss the
      possibility of working on Fluid, please contact <a href="roly.perera@cl.cam.ac.uk">Dr Roly Perera</a>,
      Early Career Advanced Fellow, Institute of Computing for Climate Science, University of Cambridge.</p>

      <h4>Project description</h4>
      <p>Charts and other visual summaries, curated by journalists and scientists from real-world data and
      simulations, are how we understand our changing world and the anthopogenic sources of that change. But
      the visual artifacts we are actually presented with are opaque: any relationship to the underlying data
      is lost. How can we expect to understand, critique or evaluate claims based on a bitmap? This is
      challenging enough for an expert with access to the source code and data used to derive the outputs; for
      a non-expert the prospects are even worse.</p>

      <p><a href="f.luid.org">Fluid</a> is a new “transparent” programming language, being developed at the
      Institute of Computing for Climate Science in Cambridge in collaboration with University of Bristol,
      that makes it easy to create charts and figures which are linked to data, enabling a user to
      interactively discover what visual elements actually represent. The key idea is to incorporating a
      bidirectional dynamic dependency analysis into the language runtime, allowing it to track dependencies
      that arise as as outputs (such as charts and tables) are computed from data. This information is then
      used to automatically enrich rendered output with interactions which allow a reader to explore the
      relationship to data directly through the artefact, by selecting visual features of interest. Fluid uses
      so-called “program slicing” techniques based on Galois connections, a neat mathematical abstraction
      which characterises exactly the relationship between sets of inputs and sets of outputs which depend on
      them.</p>

      <p>The live demos on the website show the interactive queries we currently support, but these only
      scratch the surface of what this kind of infrastructure should make possible. There are many
      opportunities for an imaginative and technically strong student to help move this idea forward. Your
      project could go in a number of directions, depending on whether your interests lie more towards
      programming languages, formal methods or data science. A programming languages project would extend
      Fluid into a literate programming tool, by adding Markdown support and the ability to embed
      computational content via a Lisp-style backquote mechanism. A more mathematical project might add
      multidimensional arrays to the language, along with various array operations inspired by linear algebra
      and an extension of the dependency analysis to these new operations. A project focused more around
      science communication would use Fluid to adapt a piece of real-world climate science into a “long-form”
      essay or interactive explanation intended for a non-specialist audience. (See <a
      href="https://distill.pub">distill.pub</a> for some examples.)</p>

      <p>If you think this sounds interesting, please get in touch to arrange an initial chat. Whatever form
      your project takes, we would aim for your work to be incorporated into our main development codebase,
      and so would form a genuine contribution to the overarching project. You will get to present your work
      to researchers and data scientists at the Institute of Computing for Climate Science and The Alan Turing
      Institute, and work with PhD students at Cambridge and Bristol. A strong background in functional
      programming, maths and/or science is a must. You can expect to gain experience in programming languages
      research, data analysis and data visualisation, with close supervisor support.</p>
