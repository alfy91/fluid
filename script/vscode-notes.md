- notification icon (bell in bottom-right corner) can give clues if things aren't working
- npm install -g [purs/spago/purescript-language-server] otherwise things won't work properly
- npm install -g [purs-tidy/purescript-psa] for formatting, better error reporting
- spago and purs need to be at same version as given in package.json
