### Installation

Ensure you have a recent version of [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/download/current/) and install using `yarn install`. The `yarn` scripts (invoked using `yarn run`) are as follows:

- `browser-test` to run tests in debug mode with Chrome
- `test` to run tests in headless mode, retesting when files change
- `bundle` to bundle the app
- `bundle-watch` to bundle the app, rebundling when files change
- `continuous-test` to run `test` and `bundle-watch` in parallel
