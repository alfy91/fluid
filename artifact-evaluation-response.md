> 1. The web app does not display several bar charts as mentioned in the artifact-evaluation.md under Step 1. I can only see the one corresponding to Fig.2 (I am using Chrome on Ubuntu). In fact, the web page itself does not speak about Fig.1 at all.

> 2. Are the visualizations meant to be interactive? If that is indeed the case, I am also not able to do that beyond 'hovering' over the bars. This may be related to my confusion regarding question 1 above.

> 3. Is it the case that the test files have .fld format and the expected outputs have .expect.fld format?

> 4. With the answer to 3 above, how do I run an individual test? The artifact-evaluation.md document often refers to the instructions above for running the test suite, but those instructions only pertain to running the entire suite, rather than individual tests.

> 5. I would like to run each test and render the visualizations, as opposed to running the tests in headless mode. If I am not mistaken, this would be required to carry out Step 4 as described in the artifact-evalaution.md
