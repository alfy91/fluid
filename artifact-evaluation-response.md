> The web app does not display several bar charts as mentioned in the artifact-evaluation.md under Step 1. I can only see the one corresponding to Fig.2 (I am using Chrome on Ubuntu). In fact, the web page itself does not speak about Fig.1 at all.

With the answer to 3 above, how do I run an individual test? The artifact-evaluation.md document often refers to the instructions above for running the test suite, but those instructions only pertain to running the entire suite, rather than individual tests.

> I would like to run each test and render the visualizations, as opposed to running the tests in headless mode. If I am not mistaken, this would be required to carry out Step 4 as described in the artifact-evalaution.md
