Suggestions/to do

- [ ] Increase font size for scatterplot axis captions
- [ ] LaTeX captions for (1a) and (1b): change to “Example scatterplot” and “Scatterplot source code”
- [ ] New title for Section 2: provisionally, maybe something like “Transparent, Self-Explanatory Charts and Figures”
- [ ] Dashes should be at least en-dashes (`--`) or em-dashes (`---`)
- [ ] "to the source code, and" -> "to the source code and"
- [ ] "multiple disparate" feels a bit redundant -- "multiple" would do
- [ ] "a widespread phenomenon throughout the sciences" -- drop this phrase, merge with this sentence into following one and streamline. For example, ..."collated from multiple sources, such as in medical meta-analyses [cite], statistical aggregation methods [cite], and database joins [cite].
- [ ] For these citations, the citations themselves need to be parenthetical (use `\citep` for that).
- [ ] "As an example of this challenge, we begin with" -> "An an example of this sort of comprehension challenge, consider"
- [ ] "presented in Figure 1b" -> "in Figure 1b"
- [ ] X-axis/Y-axis -> x-axis/y-axis
